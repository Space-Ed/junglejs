# Jungle - Organic Programming Framework

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/junglejs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/junglejs) 

## Organic
Being organic means it is designed based on the way natural systems are able to grow and develop.
Examples of such systems include.
- Cellular growth from embryo to organism.
- Ecologies of interacting organisms.
- Reproduction, ancestry, mutation of DNA.
- Cultures of free agents.

Imagine your program starting as an embryo and growing cell by cell in to a rich and fully fledged application using reusable cell patterns.
